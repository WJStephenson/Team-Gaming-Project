# Team-Gaming-Project
Mimo Team Project to collaboratively build a Gaming information site using one or more API's.

We used a combination of slack, figma and live sessions to help splt each page into an individuals task.

Illshad and Jo tackled the homepage using the GiantBomb API to dynamically populate the 4 areas based on the user input.

Azzedine completed a randomly loaded image slider from the same API on the Games page.

Hamit completed the About page with an overview of each persons role and responsibilities.
